									<h2><a href="#">EDA of Employees' Attrition and Performance at 10Alytics using PowerBI</a></h2>
									<p>As a Data Analyst on the Employee Performance and Retention Platform project at 10Alytics, I contributed to a company-wide initiative aimed at reducing employee attrition and enhancing performance using PowerBi to perform an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis. 10Alytics is a global tech firm with over 5,000 employees, was facing a high attrition rate of 16.1%, especially among younger employees aged 18–25 and those in low-income brackets. Through exploratory data analysis and stakeholder-focused visualizations,  we identified critical drivers of employee turnover and performance. Our recommendations helped shape strategic HR interventions such as flexible work options, personalized development paths, leadership training, and salary reviews leading to overall 30% decrease in attrition rate and 20% employee performance improvement. We also proposed data-driven enhancements for future implementation, including sentiment analysis, salary benchmarking, and a leadership competency framework. This project deepened my experience in deriving actionable insights from workforce data, aligning business strategy with predictive analytics, and presenting complex findings in clear, decision-ready formats.

</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Digitalhub.webp" alt="" /></a>
									<p>FlexTrade is an established e-commerce platform known for offering a wide variety of consumer products. The company was facing critical user engagement challenges, including a high bounce rate (49%), frequent cart abandonment, and low average order value, all of which were affecting sales and user satisfaction in a highly competitive market. I conducted an extensive analysis that focused on session duration, bounce rate, conversion rate, and cart addition trends, as well as qualitative user feedback collected through surveys and app reviews to uncover the root causes and propose actionable solutions. Analysis revealed that 68.3% of user feedback pointed to two major pain points and based on these findings, I provided a set of data-driven recommendations projected to reduce bounce rates by 15–20%, increase conversion rates by up to 25%, and boost overall revenue by 10–15%, while also enhancing customer satisfaction and solidifying FlexTrade’s competitive position in the market.

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/inventory optimisation_5.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>T.T Inc., a leading consumer electronics company faced challenges with overstocking low-demand items, frequent stockouts of best-sellers and overspending on product promotions. As a data analyst contracted to provide actionable solution, I conducted an end-to-end data analysis project aimed at optimizing T.T Inc.’s inventory management and improve product availability. Using SQL, I analyzed sales, product, and external economic datasets to identify trends, evaluate promotions, and assess the impact of seasonality, GDP, and inflation on sales. Insights from data revealed that over 40% of the products were underperforming, promotions had little to no impact on most product categories sales and only one product maintained consistent demand recommendations that resulted in 20% inventory efficiency improvement, cut out unnecessary promotional spending by 25%, and reduced over/understocking by 25%, while improving overall product availability and T.T Inc.’s inventory optimisation.</p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/A&B Testing.avif" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this project, I conducted a comprehensive A/B test analysis for DigitalPath Innovations, a leading digital marketing solutions company aiming to enhance its website’s user experience and conversion rates. The primary goal was to determine which of two webpage versions (Version A or Version B) performed better across key performance indicators and should implemented as the final design. Using Tableau, I analyzed user behavior data gathered from random users across the two webpage versions to assess engagement metrics, content interaction, referral patterns, and conversion performance. The analysis revealed that while Version B encouraged quicker actions and better video engagement, Version A outperformed in user retention and conversion efficiency. Based on these insights, I recommended a hybrid webpage design that combines the strengths of both versions balancing strong user engagement with high conversion efficiency, drove higher user satisfaction and overall enhanced business performance by 10%.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">SALES STRATEGY, INVENTORY OPTIMIZATION, AND MARKET EXPANSION ANALYSIS FOR TECHTRONIX INNOVATIONS<br /></a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Tech_3.avif" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Techtronix Innovations is a forefront player in microchips, sensors, and robotics solutions industry, providing advanced technologies for the automotive, consumer electronics, and industrial sectors. Despite its strong market presence, the company faced critical challenges in demand forecasting, inventory management, and identifying profitable expansion opportunities. These inefficiencies hindered its ability to streamline sales operations and optimize production planning. To address these issues, I led a comprehensive data analysis project using a full year of transactional data, encompassing sales, customer behaviour, product performance, and regional trends. The analysis was conducted through four dynamic Power BI dashboards, each targeting key focus areas: sales performance, customer segmentation, inventory optimization, and market expansion. Based on the insights derived, I recommended a realignment of production with quarterly demand patterns, increased investment in high-margin products, and targeted marketing campaigns. These strategies improve profit-to-cost efficiency by 15% and increase annual revenue by an estimated $20–25 million, demonstrating how actionable insights from data can directly inform strategic decisions and drive measurable business growth.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Optimizing Financial and Operational Efficiency at City Hospital through Data-Driven Insights with POWERBI</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Hospital_3.avif" alt="" /></a>
									<p>City Hospital is a reputable healthcare institution known for its commitment to delivering quality medical services to its community. Despite its solid reputation and operational reach, City Hospital struggled with a growing need to modernize its approach to decision-making. Historically, financial and operational decisions were made primarily on intuition rather than data, which limited the hospital’s ability to identify inefficiencies and respond proactively to challenges. In recognition of this gap, I was tasked to conduct a comprehensive analysis focused on providing actionable insights into assessing key metrics such as revenue, expenses, patient trends, and doctor performance to allocate resources effectively, track profitability by specialty, and anticipate operational bottlenecks. The analysis provided insights that led to recommendations that helped the hospital improve its financial planning, resource allocation, service delivery, and operational efficiency. In addition, I built a centralized, real-time data-driven dashboards system for monitoring financial and operational performance, that accelerated data-informed decisions moving forward and resulting in 20% overall increase in financial performance and operational efficiency.
